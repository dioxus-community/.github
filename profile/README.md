# Dioxus Community 🤝

We are a community organization with the goal of developing and maintaining libraries 📦 and resources 📗 for [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) 🧬!

Some of these libraries have been made from scratch, others have been adopted:
- [dioxus-redux](https://github.com/dioxus-community/dioxus-redux) 🧰
- [dioxus-animations](https://github.com/dioxus-community/dioxus-animations) ⏯
- [dioxus-resize-observer](https://github.com/dioxus-community/dioxus-resize-observer) 📐
- [dioxus-charts](https://github.com/dioxus-community/dioxus-charts) 📈
- [dioxus-community/dioxus-free-icons](https://github.com/dioxus-community/dioxus-free-icons) ⚙️
- And more to come!
